  <b><p>Why should you adopt?</p></b>
<p>1. You're saving a life:  Any shelter cat- old, young or, at-risk- need stable homes. Due to a lack of resources, shelters often euthanize animals they consider unadoptable first. These "unadoptables" include older cats, black cats, and kittens with physical challenges.</p>
<p>2. Animal shelters are one-stop shopping for your perfect companion: You won't have to go from place to place to find your perfect love. Your local shelter will have a great selection of colors, temperaments, ages, and activity levels.</p>
<p>3. Save Money: Many shelters include spay/neuter surgery, vaccinations, and viral tests in the adoption fee. If your vet performed these procedures, it would cost much more. Sometimes shelters even include food, litter, accessories, and toys. Such a deal!</p>
<p>4. Cats enrich our lives:  Research shows there are health benefits associated with owning a cat. Having a cat lowers blood pressure and decreases the risk of heart attack and stroke. The presence of a cat diminishes loneliness and depression.</p>
<p>5. Cats provide comfort during times of grief: Not only would a furry friend help you deal with loneliness and grief from the death of a human or animal companion, by saving a life, good comes from tragedy.</p>
